Description: PostgreSQL Backup Manager
 PgBackMan is a tool for managing PostgreSQL logical backups created
 with pg_dump and pg_dumpall.
 .
 It is designed to manage backups from thousands of databases running
 in multiple PostgreSQL nodes, and it supports a multiple backup
 server topology.
 .
 It also manages role and database configuration information when
 creating a backup of a database. This information is necessary to
 ensure a 100% restoration of a logical backup of a database and the
 elements associated to it.
 .
 PgBackMan is not a tool for managing PITR (Point in time recovery)
 backups. There are several other solutions that can be used for
 managing PITR backups, such as PITRTools, OmniPITR, and Barman.
